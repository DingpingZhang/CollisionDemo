# CollisionDemo

Broad-phase collision detection is added to optimize performance, which will be significantly improved when the number of particles is large and the distribution of particles is sparse.

See [here](./BenchmarkReports/BenchmarkTest.ForceDetectVsBroadPhase-report-github.md) for the performance differences between `broad-phase` and `force-detect` .
