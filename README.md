# CollisionDemo

Broad-phase collision detection is added to optimize performance, which is significantly improved in the case of large and sparse particles.

See [here](./BenchmarkReports/BenchmarkTest.ForceDetectVsBroadPhase-report-github.md) for the performance differences between `broad-phase` and `force-detect` .
